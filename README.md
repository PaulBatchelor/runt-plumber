# Runt-Plumber

A work in progress!

Runt-plumber is set of 
[runt](http://www.github.com/paulbatchelor/runt.git)
bindings for Soundplumber, the internal 
sound engine and API for the 
[Sporth](http://www.github.com/paulbatchelor/sporth.git) language. 

Runt-plumber also comes with sporth.rnt, a runt dictionary containing some
handy words to use, including many words in Sporth.
